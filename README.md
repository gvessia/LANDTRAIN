# LANDTRAIN
This code, written in R language, calculates the rainfall event that is responsible for shallow landslide initiation. 
This event is calculated in terms of Duration (D) and Cumulated rainfall (E) that likely initiated a shallow landslide.
This approach has been developed and tested on Italian shallow landslide events occurred in the decade 2002-2012 years.
