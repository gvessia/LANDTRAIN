# LANDTRAIN
This code, written in R, calculates the rainfall event that is responsible for single shallow landslide initiation. 
This event is calculated in terms of Duration (D) and Cumulated rainfall (E). 
This approach has been developed and tested on Italian territory, based on shallow landslide events occurred in the decade 2002-2012.
